The Components of Data
======================

What is data?  To answer this question, we will first focus on an individual
piece of data and then think about a collection of data.

Understanding Data Individually
-------------------------------

Data consists of a **measurement** taken on **something**.  In statistics, we
call the measurement a *variable* and the item being measured an *individual* or
*unit*.

.. glossary::
    Individual or Unit
        The object or person being measured.  
    Variable
        The specific measurement that is being taken on an individual.

.. note::

    When determining the **variable** related to a study, it is helpful the
    think of the question that we would ask about the individual.

Here are some examples of data from my own life

    * I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
    * My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.
    * This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea.

In each case, we can think of the description as a measurement on some
individual unit.

Examples: Identify the individuals (What is the unit being measured?)

.. mchoice::     data_mc1
    :answer_a:   A movie I streamed online
    :answer_b:   All movies I streamed online
    :answer_c:   3 stars (out of 5 stars)
    :answer_d:   The average rating of all movies I have streamed
    :correct:    a
    :feedback_a: When discussing a movie rating, the unit being measured is a movie
    :feedback_b: This answer is related to a <i>collection</i> of data
    :feedback_c: You have identified <i>what</i> is measured, not <i>who</i>
    :feedback_d: This answer is related to a <i>collection</i> of data

    I rated the last movie I streamed online as 3 stars (out of 5 stars).
    Identify the individual.

.. mchoice::     data_mc2
    :answer_a:   64 GB of flash storage
    :answer_b:   My phone
    :answer_c:   The amount of memory in my current phone
    :correct:    b
    :feedback_a: This is measurement taken, not the thing being measured
    :feedback_b: The amount of memory is a measurement on a phone
    :feedback_c: This is a good description of the amount being measured.  Who/what is being measured?

    My current phone has 64 GB of flash memory.

.. caution::

    While it might be possible to think of the individual here as *me* and not
    *my phone*, there could be problems with this designation.  For example,
    what if I own two phones.  We need to be very careful and specific when
    defining an individual.

.. mchoice::     data_mc3
    :answer_a:   A morning
    :answer_b:   Amount of iced tea consumed in a morning.
    :answer_c:   two 20oz. glasses
    :answer_d:   20 ounces 
    :correct:    
    :feedback_a: But we should be more specific.  Perhaps a weekend morning in August would be more specific.
    :feedback_b: This is a good description of what is being measure. Who/what is being measured?
    :feedback_c: This is the specific value of a measurement.  Who/what is being measured?
    :feedback_d: This is the unit of measurement. Who/what is being measured?


    This morning I consumed two 20 oz. glasses of iced tea.
